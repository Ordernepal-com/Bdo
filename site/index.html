		<h1>What is Bdo (Seal) and Hilo if you are a developer both projects are J2EE, they are:</h1>

		<ul>
			<li>Spring</li>
			<li>Hibernate</li>
			<li>Gradle</li>
			<li>Sitemesh</li>
			<li>Groovy</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The framework used to develop the project is called Grails Yes, another framework, Grails is so special though that it can be considered a productivity tool instead of a framework. A light tool that sits on top of J2EE project structure where Groovy is leveraged and when deployed becomes a J2EE project.</p>

		<p>Grails is domain driven, leverages Groovy which is an abstraction of Java (you can write Java code within a Groovy class file), object oriented and in summary is a productivity tool. Attempt to write the same logic in any other technology stack of choice without missing out on Java's greatest assets and you're talking years of development instead of months. Customizations are quick as well. Everything, Models, Views and Controllers are nicely configured/glued together to create one seemless development experience.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781590599952" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline;color:blue;">The Definitive Guide to Grails</a>. is a little dated, but gives a great run down of MVC (Model View Controller setup), Grails and why it is important. Not very many assumptions are made on how much you know, you will be starting from scratch with this book.</p>

		<p>Seal deploys to an Java application server of choice or can be run locally in an embedded container You can use many of the RDBM systems out there (Postgres, MySQL) and have been configured to work with Mongo and others.</p>
